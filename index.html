               <H2>  The Wood School of Music is available to teach your children basic music skills </h2>
               <h3>Our philosphy is based on the idea that being a parent is hard and your offspring 
                  have decided to take up a musical instrument which can make it even harder. <br/>
                  We take them off your hands for an hour a week to teach them basic music skills until they get bored
                  and move onto their next obsession.</h3>
